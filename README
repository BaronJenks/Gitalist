Gitalist - a transitional project to convert gitweb.cgi to a Catalyst app.

The idea behind this project is to move gitweb.cgi away from a single
monolithic CGI script and into a modern Catalyst app. Fortunately this is not
as daunting as it might seem at first as gitweb.cgi follows an MVC type
structure. Once gitweb.cgi has been suitably Catalysed then it can move from
being a "this was once gitweb.cgi" to a project of its own (hence the
"transitional" in the description).

As it stands Gitalist is very much in its infancy and hasn't got far
beyond a layout template and a single controller. Probably the next step is
moving an existing action into a new Catalyst action and lay down the code
to make porting further actions, or writing new ones, as simple as possible.
After that provide a model based on one of the git modules, either the Git.pm
that comes with git or Git::PurePerl, and deprecate or port the existing
gitweb.cgi functions.

USAGE

To get Gitalist up and running just set $projectroot in gitweb.conf to point
to the directory contains your repositories. With that done the usual:

  perl script/gitalist_server.pl

should do the trick.

DEPENDENCIES

  Catalyst
  IO::Capture::Stdout;
